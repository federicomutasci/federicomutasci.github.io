      <title>Temperature, Heat Waves and Industrial Production</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my single-author job market paper - which is currently unpublished and part of my PhD thesis - I undertake an extensive and granular analysis of the impact of climate change on the Italian manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper uses a panel dataset of georeferenced balance sheet information from hundreds of thousands of Italian manufacturing companies, combined with high-resolution daily climate data. Using this large dataset, I estimate the immediate and long-term effects that rising temperatures and intense heat waves have on the output, productivity, and input usage of manufacturing companies, thanks to dynamic microeconometric models. The paper is well suited to identifying structural vulnerabilities and policy instruments that can guide climate change adaptation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pollution and Real Estate Devaluation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blogs/hedonicpricingta/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of my first empirical work, my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis in economics: Mutasci, F. (2019). &amp;ldquo;The Impact of Pollution on Property Price Evaluation: A Spatial Approach to Hedonic Pricing Models&amp;rdquo;, University of Milan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the study is to investigate one of the problems affecting the economy of the city of Taranto, namely the possibility that the deposit of polluting particulate matter (PM10) related to the presence of the former ILVA\ArcelorMittal steelworks exacerbates the decline in property values in working-class neighborhoods. The study uses a set of geolocated data on houses for sale with corresponding hedonic characteristics, including pollution levels estimated using IDW interpolation of ARPA weather station samples, controlling for socioeconomic variables. The research design enriches classic hedonic pricing models through the use of spatial lag matrices, estimating SAR and SEM models with the maximum likelihood method, showing that, although higher concentration of pullutant particles predicts a drop in property price, the devaluation of houses for sale appears to be mainly confined to the suburban neighborhood called “Tamburi”, located next to the steel mill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
